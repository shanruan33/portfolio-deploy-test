            With a huge passion in coding and a background in design, I am motivated to integrate the logic of programming with the beauty of design into web applications.

          <p class="text">
            I enjoy exploring web technologies and solving coding puzzles. Before, I used to study and work on UX in the aspects of product design and product management for more than 5 years. Enabled by those knowledge and experience, now I create better programming solutions for user-friendly interactions in web products.

            In addition, I am also good at working and communicating in cross-culture and cross-discipline environments, since I was graduated from top business school in UK and employed in 4 countries (United States, Denmark, China and New Zealand).
