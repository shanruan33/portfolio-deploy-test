          <p class="text">
            I enjoy exploring frontend technologies and solving coding puzzles. Before, I used to study and work on UX in the aspects of product design and product management for more than 5 years. Enabled by those knowledge and experience, now I create better programming solutions for user-friendly interactions in web products.
